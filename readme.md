# Track Symfony 

A web app to track the Symfony project.

This is to explain the design decisions I've made.

I've chosen Laravel  because it's the framewok I'm most familiar with. Plus the fact that it's highly opionionated to a specific kind of design instead of supporting many types, makes it easier to develop projects in less time.
